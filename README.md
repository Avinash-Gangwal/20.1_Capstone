### Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Capstone Project

**Author**  
@Avinash

#### Executive Summary  
This capstone project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry by analyzing customer demographics, service usage patterns, and billing information. Using the Telecom Customer dataset from Kaggle, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and apply machine learning algorithms to identify key factors influencing churn and develop a predictive model.

#### Rationale  
Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies as it directly impacts revenue and customer retention strategies. By understanding the drivers of churn, businesses can proactively address customer concerns, optimize services, and improve customer satisfaction.

#### Research Question  
How can we develop a predictive model to identify the most effective factors influencing customer churn in the telecom industry, and what are the key drivers of customer retention?

#### Data Sources  
- **Telecom Customer Dataset (Kaggle)**: This dataset contains customer information such as demographics, service usage statistics, billing details, and a binary "Churn" target variable.

#### Methodology  
The project involves:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To understand data characteristics and relationships between variables.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful predictors for churn analysis.
4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
5. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

#### Results  
The analysis aims to highlight significant predictors of churn and evaluate the performance of various machine learning models. Insights will be visualized for better interpretation.

#### Next Steps  
- Deploy predictive models into production environments.
- Experiment with advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
- Develop targeted campaigns based on model insights.
